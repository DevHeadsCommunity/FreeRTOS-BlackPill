# FreeRTOS-BlackPill
This Repository is For Those who want's to learn to port FreeRTOS also who wants to Learn to write own Driver 

## Objectives 
  - Showing How to Port FreeRTOS for STM32 MCU's
  - Writig own Driver code and implement that with FreeRTOS
  - How to Do some advance Task using own Written Basic Drivers
  - It also contains *printk* which is used to logged data via USART2 peripheral
## Plan 
1. Setting FreeRTOS First and Test it is working or not
2. Fixing The structure of the project
3. Adding Custom Driver
4. Testing those Driver with FreeRTOS
5. Once Driver's are complete adding some library to control certain things like Display, Motors and Sensors

## Progress 
1. FreeRTOS is already set
2. Porject Structure is also done
3. UART Driver is written (Blocking)
4. GPIO Driver is also under development
